# ts-import-patch

This is a simple module that add the `.js` extension to js imports without it.
This is typically the case when using ES modules in node with typescript

Works for Unix systems only. I have not tested on Windows since windows uses a different path delimiter

## Usage

```bash
 # tsp /path/to/transpiled/ts/code
 tsp ./dist
```
